## Details

I used react to do this pset because react is a nice framework that
encourages nice modular reusable components. All the dependencies
should be included here, but if they aren't just run `npm install`
or run `yarn`. To execute the code run `npm start` and that will run
a server on `localhost:3000`.

## TLDR
run `npm start`

## Code Organization

All of my js and css code is in `/src`. `App.js` has the base code for the
corkboard. The html is located in `/public`. There is then the `Note.jsx`
which contains the logic around each post it note. `utils.js` contains useful
functions and objects. `BoardHeader.jsx` contains the banner for the corkboard
and the functions for adding new notes.

## Libraries

React.js
React-Draggable.js (for DnD functionality)
